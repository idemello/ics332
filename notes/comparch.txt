Multiple levels of cache
L1 , L2 , L3

size factor L1 < L2 < L3. 

L1 closest to CPU data cache/instructions cache

Chunks of data are brought from far-away memory and are copied
and kept around in nearby caches
    same data exist in mutiple levels of of memory at once
    leads to problems (may not be discussed)


DIRECT MEMORY ACCESS (DMA)

When copying large chunks of data in the Von-Neumann model, the CPU has to be involved for each copy operation.
memory copies take a long time, even using caches.
DMA copies directly to memory

DMA is used on all modern computers

DMA uses memory bus
while DMA is active CPU likely also uses the mory bus

CURRENT ARCHITECTURES

Because constructors cannot increase clock rate further
current CPUs are multi-core

multi core is a good idea not because more cores are better,
but because more cores are more efficient due to power/heat issues.
