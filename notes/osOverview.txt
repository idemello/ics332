Why study operationg systems

    Be a better developer
    understand what can and what cannot be done
    understand and imporve prgram performance
    understand how/why some os can be better than some others

What is an OS?

ok answer: its the software layer between the applications and the hardware

better: all the code i dont have to write when I develop software

WRONG: It is the one program that runs at all times and watches everything
        this is wrong because:
            the OS is not a running program
            there is no need to reserve a CPU core for it 

What is an OS?
    
    The OS is a Resource Abstractor: defines a set of logical
    resources that correspond to hardware resources, and well-defined
    operations on these logical resources
        CPU --> Running programs
        Memory (DRAM/SDRAM/Futrue RAM -> REad Write..
        Storage Medium HDD SSD --> Filse

    The OS is a resource Allocatior it decides (which running program)
    gets how much.
